# miniproject
Mini project for the course COMP202 in university 3rd semester.
It's a program for Banks to ease the customer by providing token to each client.
We used Queue data structure to print TOKEN for clients and call clients with their tokens by bank staff.
The code in the main file could be changed as required for changing pin number if the bank wants to give access to issuing a token only to client, function of calling client to only bank staff and termination of the Token system to only bank administrator.
